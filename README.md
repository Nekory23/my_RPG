{EPITECH} | First year | C Graphical Programming project

This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own RPG.
Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your
team know.

Your game must follow the following rules:

  - The player needs to have characteristics which you can find in the status menu.
  - The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.
  - There must be NPC in your game.
  - You need to implement at least one quest.
  - The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.
  - The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.
  - With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.
  
To give the users the feeling that youâ€™re delivering a complete product you need to polish as much as possible
your game.

  - Having a pleasant user interface.
  - Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, ... )
  - Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.
  - Create a game with a beginning and an end.
